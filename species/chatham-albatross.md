## LOCAL NAME(S)

None

## DISTRIBUTION IN CHILE

Records

## HABITAT

Marine, although less pelagic than other albatrosses.

## DESCRIPTION

Length: 90 cm.<br><br>

Adult with dark gray crown, face, and throat (darker than T. salvini); yellow bill with dark spot on tip of lower jaw. Wings dark gray above, white below with a contrasting dark line on the lower leading edge of the underwings. White stomach.

## FOOD

It has not been well studied but it is thought to correspond mainly to squid and fish ((Marchant and Higgins, 1990; IUCN 2014). Also crustaceans and offal. It follows ships (del Hoyo et al. 1992; rev. 2014).

## REPRODUCTION

It nests only on a large rock called "The Pyramid", a very small area located south of Pitt Island, SE of the Chatham Islands, off New Zealand, on the slopes and edges of cliffs. The nest is a mound of mud, feathers, and vegetation. A single white egg with reddish brown spots towards the blunt side.

## OBSERVATIONS

Considered by some authors as a subspecies of the White-crowned Albatross (Thalassarche cauta).<br><br>

It nests in the Chatham Islands and is distributed towards the East of the Pacific Ocean.<br><br>

Habitat conditions on the island deteriorated after an extreme storm in 1985 and consequently the species was classified as critically endangered by the IUCN. Since 1998 there has been an improvement in soil and vegetation conditions, which is why it has been reclassified as Vulnerable (IUCN 2014).

## DISTRIBUTION (Clement's checklist 6.9)

Chatham Islands (Chile).

## IUCN CLASSIFICATION (2019)

VU: Vulnerable

## THREATS

Very small breeding range, restricted to a single breeding site (La Pir√°mide), making it susceptible to stochastic events and human impacts (IUCN 2019).<br><br>

Trawling and longline fishing.

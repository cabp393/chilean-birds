## REPRODUCTION

It nests on the Ildefonso and Evout Islands, near Cape Horn; Diego Ramirez, from the States, Falkland and South Georgia; among others. Studies indicate that it preferentially nests on Saunders Island (in the South Sandwich Islands), where it is estimated that each year during the month of September, around 370,000 pairs arrive, which is equivalent to approximately 70% of the world population. Relatively stable couple form. Laying of an egg during October, whose incubation lasts between 68 and 72 days, hatching around Christmas. The youngsters take four months to become independent to go to the high seas around May for 6 or 7 years, and then return as adults to nest on the same island.

## OBSERVATIONS

It is the most common albatross in the Chilean seas and coasts. It inhabits from the Tropic of Capricorn to the 60° S parallel, and can be seen not only on the high seas, but also in ports, bays and coasts between these latitudes, and sometimes outside of them. Following the Humboldt current it can reach the north of Peru.
Similar to the Grey-headed Albatross (Thalassarche chrysostoma), it differs from it by having a totally white head and a yellow beak; unlike its similar one, which has a somewhat grayish head and a black beak with a yellow upper vertex. Live about 50 years.

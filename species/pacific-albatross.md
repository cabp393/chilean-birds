## OBSERVATIONS

There are two lines for this breed: one that includes it as a subspecies of Buller's Albatross (Thalassarche bulleri bulleri), a line followed by the SACC and some authors; and another that indicates that recent molecular studies suggest that it has sufficient characteristics to ensure its species rank.<br><br>
In both cases, the denomination platei in the scientific name is misapplied, since that is how an immature bulleri was named for the first time.<br><br>
Martinez and Gonzalez (2005), who mention it in their work as an albatross that migrates to Peruvian and Chilean waters during its non-breeding period, and which has been photographed by the authors on several occasions on the central coast of Chile, consider it a species itself, separated from T. bulleri (Tickell, 2000), based on DNA analysis. They also indicate that their wings are more rounded, and in ventral view they have a wide black leading edge, wider than in the Buller's Albatross (Thalassarche bulleri), and therefore only its definitive denomination is pending.

There is a dark morph (ssp. grallaria) on Lord Howe Island (a small island 600 km E of Australia) that does not reach Chile (Jaramillo 2014).<br><br>

However, in March 2013, a dark morph individual was recorded in the waters of A. Selkirk Island (Masafuera) that could represent a vagrant from Lord Howe or an unknown dark morph population in Juan Fernandez (E. de Juana in of the Hole).

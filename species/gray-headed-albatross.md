## REPRODUCTION

In subantarctic islands such as South Georgia, Prince Edwards, Campbell, Kerguelen, Crozet.<br><br>

Eggs every two years feeding near their nesting sites. In the non-breeding season it disperses throughout the oceans.

## OBSERVATIONS

It moves using dynamic glide, curving the wings at rigorous times. rarely follows fishing boats.<br><br>

Similar to the Black-browed Albatross (Thalassarche melanophris), it differs from it by having a gray head and a yellow beak with black sides. However, they have very similar habits, and the two species are generally found together on the high seas, except during the nesting season when both maintain separate territories, although sometimes close to each other.

## DISTRIBUTION (Clements 6.8)

Antarctic circumpolar, northward to 45° S. However, following the cold Humboldt Current to N Chile and S Peru (15° S).

## IUCN CLASSIFICATION (2019)

EN: Endangered

## THREATS

Listed as Endangered (EN) based on data from South Georgia, which is home to about half of the world's population, indicating a very rapid rate of global population decline over three generations (90 years). The main cause is likely to be incidental mortality from longline fishing (IUCN 2019).

## OBSERVATIONS

Together with the Black-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus melacoryphus) and the Yellow-billed Cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), the Matacaballos is one of the three representatives of the Cuckoos in Chile, birds that live mainly in the forests of tropical America.<br><br>

Although Matacaballos is located in the extreme north of the country, there are only a few records of cuckoos, including skins found in fields or streams.<br><br>

It owes its curious name to its type of food, consisting of insects and parasites that animals (mainly cattle and horses) carry in their bodies, and to the belief that the locals of the extreme north had that these birds, being perched on the animal, caused the wounds on their bodies.<br><br>

Due to its color and shape, it is an impossible bird to confuse. It is found in groups or flocks, generally in pastures with cattle and horses, and has an undulating flight similar to that of the Thrush (Curaeus curaeus) consisting of a flapping of the wings and then a glide with closed wings.

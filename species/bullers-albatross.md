## OBSERVATIONS

Deep-sea bird that has rarely been seen off the Chilean coast. It seems that it crosses from south to north following the Humboldt current. It nests on the Snares and Chatham Islands, near New Zealand, spending the rest of the time over the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere.

It nests on islands near New Zealand; range to the W. South Pacific (Chile).

## IUCN CLASSIFICATION (2019)

NT: Near Threatened

## THREATS

Listed as Near Threatened (NT) because, although it is restricted to a small area when it breeds, the population is stable and the islands on which it breeds are moderately widespread, making it unlikely that is highly threatened in a short time due to human activities or stochastic events (IUCN 2019).

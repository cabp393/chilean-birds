Considered by the SACC as a subspecies of the Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans antipodensis). The proposal to raise it to the rank of species did not pass. Tickell (2000), Martinez & Gonzalez (2004), Onley & Scofield (2007), IUCN (2014) and Zoonomen.net consider it to be a proper species.

Martinez and Gonzalez (2005) mention it in their work as a species that can be found in the Chilean sea, indicating that there is a record with photographs in the Los Chonos Archipelago (2004). Other photographic records off Valparaiso in 2009 and 2010 (see photographs by Pablo Caceres).

## Distribution

It nests in the Antipodes Islands and (in smaller numbers) in Is. Campbell (New Zealand); marine range to the Tasman Sea and S of the O. Pacific (Chile)

## Threats

Bycatch in tuna and swordfish longline fishing. Feral pigs and cats in their nesting areas (IUCN 2014).

This species is considered to be experiencing a very rapid decline in population size (IUCN 2019).

## IUCN CLASSIFICATION (2019)

NT: Near Threatened

## ORDER

Procellariiformes

## FAMILY

Diomedeidae

## NAME IN SPANISH RECOMMENDED BY THE S.E.O

Albatros tiznado

## Monotypic

Phoebetria palpebrata (Forster)<br>
Light-mantled sooty albatross<br><br>

Phoebetria (Greek mythology) = of Phoebe, goddess of the moon<br>
palpebr (L - palpebrae) = eyelid<br>
atra (L - ater) = black<br><br>

Black Eyed Moon Goddess

## LOCAL NAME(S)

Pajaro carnero negro, pastor

## DISTRIBUTION IN CHILE

Between the Antarctic Circle and latitude 35° S. Occasionally N to latitude 20° S.

## HABITAT

Pelagic

## DESCRIPTION

Length: 78 - 93 cm.<br>
Wingspan: 183 - 232 cm.<br><br>

dark head Mantle, back, chest and abdomen ash. Wing coverts dark gray to black. White semicircle behind the eye. Dark gray cuneate tail. Bill black with longitudinal blue or purple line on the lower jaw. Greyish legs.

## FOOD

Mainly cephalopods and krill. Also other crustaceans, fish and carrion; remains of birds, viscera and fat of mammals that are found floating.

## REPRODUCTION

Every two years, when the breeding is successful. Unlike the other species of albatross, they usually nest in high areas or cliffs exposed to the wind, where it is easy to take flight. Egg size: 100 x 66 mm. app.

## OBSERVATIONS

It is one of the albatrosses with the southernmost distribution. Although it can reach the height of Tarapaca (lat. 20° S) to the north, it is normally found from latitude 35° S and even below the Antarctic Circle.<br><br>
It is distinguished from the other albatrosses by its dark color; and the Dusky Albatross (Phoebetria fusca), on the lighter back and breast. Also, the longitudinal line on the lower jaw is blue or purple and not orange; unlike the Dusky Albatross in that it is yellow or orange.<br><br>

Perhaps because of its slimmer body compared to other albatross species, and because of its narrower wings, they allow greater flexibility in flight; being able to change its speed more easily, stay stationary in the air at will, and land or take off from the ground without great problems.

## DISTRIBUTION (Clement's checklist 6.9)

Subantarctic circumpolar islands; range N to 35° S (Chile)

## THREATS

Classified as Near Threatened (NT) as it may be declining due to bycatch in longline fisheries and possibly impacts from introduced predators. However, the threats and population status remain poorly understood (IUCN 2019).

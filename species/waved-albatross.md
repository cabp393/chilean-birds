Waved albatross

## LOCAL NAME(S)

None

## DISTRIBUTION IN CHILE

Records

## HABITAT

Warm water pelagic.

## DESCRIPTION

Length: 90 cm.<br>
Wingspan: 230-240 cm.<br>
Weight: 2 kg.<br><br>

Brown back. Greyish brown underparts. Brown wings above; and pale below edged with brown. White head and neck; yellow washed back neck. Large yellow beak. Brown tail.

## FOOD

Apparently a scavenger of dead prey. Also fish and squid.

## REPRODUCTION

It nests only on the Española (Galapagos) and La Plata islands, off the coast of Ecuador. Single egg, white, laid on bare ground; size of 106 x 69 mm.

## OBSERVATIONS

Distinguishing features are the conspicuously long neck and the long pale yellow bill. It is the only tropical albatross that in the non-breeding season moves in the seas adjacent to these islands, generally between 4° N and 12° S, with records between the waters of Colombia to the north and the extreme north of Chile to the south.<br><br>

Pelagic bird of warm waters, it is unlikely that it can be seen in the Chilean sea except in the years in which the El Niño Phenomenon has occurred, where the temperature of the water increases.

## RECORDS IN CHILE

Cited by A. Jaramillo (2003) who mentions recent records in the waters of Arica and Antofagasta.<br>
M. Marin (2004) classifies it as a Hypothetical Species since it indicates that its presence in Chile is based only on sightings.<br>
Martinez and Gonzalez (2004) indicate that its presence was confirmed up to 30° 16' S (offshore off Tongoy, 1998) as the southernmost record (Mackiernan et al., 2001).<br><br>

In the article "Some Unpublished Evidence of Rare Birds in Chile" (R. Barros - La Chiricoca 11, part 3), reference is made to the first two photographic records of this bird in Chilean waters. The first corresponding to 11/27/1997, 15 miles off Arica in a pelagic led by Armas Hill; and the second on 03/02/2004 in an area similar to the previous one in which Barbara Knapton and Raul Herrera photographed another specimen.<br><br>

ObsChile (message 9753): Rodrigo Reyes indicates that on March 3, 2012, a specimen was sighted heading southwest about 8 miles offshore in front of Punta Curaumilla (33Â° 08' S) in Valparaiso, corresponding to this as the most southern for now.<br> Photographic record of Julien Boulanger. (Note on Record, Reyes & Romo, 2012 - .pdf)<br><br>

Rodrigo Tapia indicates in an email: "I attach two photos taken on Tuesday, November 13 (2012) during a pelagic from Quintero. It would be the second record of the Galapagos Albatross, Phoebastria irrorata, in the waters of Central Chile. This constitutes, together with another record from March of this year to the southernmost record known for the species and one of the few documented records for the country".<br><br>

Record of Jorge Fuentes F. during a pelagic in Arica, on February 09, 2018.

## DISTRIBUTION (Clement's checklist 6.9)

Nests on Española (Galapagos Islands) and Isla La Plata, off Ecuador (Chile).

## IUCN CLASSIFICATION (2019)

CR: Critically Endangered

## THREATS

Intentional capture for human consumption as food and feathers. Bycatch. Nest predation by rats and cats in Isla La Plata. Environmental variations produced by the El Niño phenomenon. To a lesser extent ingestion of plastics (IUCN 2014).<br><br>

Extremely small breeding range, essentially limited to one island, and evidence suggests that it has experienced recent population declines related to bycatch mortality in artisanal fisheries in its main foraging areas (IUCN 2019).

## LOCAL NAME(S)

Albatros, pajaro carnero, carnero del cabo.

## DISTRIBUTION IN CHILE

High seas between latitudes 30°S and 60°S. Sometimes it reaches latitude 16°S following the Humboldt Current; and to the south to the Antarctic ice.

## HABITAT

Pelagic

## DESCRIPTION

Length: 112 - 135 cm.<br>
Wingspan: 250 - 350 cm.<br><br>

Male: White body. White wings with black primaries; large wing coverts mottled black towards wingtips. White increases with age. Bill pale pink with nostrils gently sloping upwards. Flesh-colored webbed feet.<br>
Female: smaller with brown crown.<br>
Juveniles: brown with white sides of face and underwings; brown legs.

## FOOD

Fish and cephalopods. It follows boats, with Cod (Dissostichus eleginoides) being the main fish in its diet, potentially obtained from their remains (IUCN 2015).

## REPRODUCTION

Nests on open or irregular vegetation near mounds or exposed ridges.

## OBSERVATIONS

Species of wide circumpolar distribution. In both the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons they have large feeding areas. Satellite tracking data indicate that during the breeding season they can feed at very long distances from the colonies (up to 4,000 km).

## DISTRIBUTION (Clement's checklist 6.9)

(Chile)

## UCN CLASSIFICATION (2019)

VU: Vulnerable

## THREATS

On Crozet and Kerguelen Islands, populations declined rapidly between 1970 - 1986, then stabilized, but have recently declined again. Longline fishing is likely to be the main cause of the decline of this species, causing reductions in adult survival and juvenile recruitment. This threat is ongoing.<br><br>

On the South Georgia Islands, this species has experienced a rapid decline over three generations (70 years).
(IUCN 2019).

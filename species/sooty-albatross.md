## LOCAL NAME(S)

## DISTRIBUTION IN CHILE

Records

## HABITAT

Pelagic

## DESCRIPTION

Length: 84 - 89 cm.<br>
Wingspan: 203 cm.<br><br>

Head, mantle, back and chest ashy brown; darker towards lorums. Abdomen somewhat lighter. Wing coverts ashen brown, darker towards the greater coverts. White semicircle in the eye. Dark gray cuneate tail. Bill black with longitudinal yellow or orange line on the lower jaw. Flesh-white legs.

## FOOD

Mainly cephalopods; to a lesser extent fish and carrion. Follow ships.

## REPRODUCTION

It nests on the islands of Tristan da Cunha, Gough, Kerguelen and Amsterdam and probably on other remote ones, occupying slopes and cliffs with vegetation, especially tall grass.

## OBSERVATIONS

Pelagic, rarely approaches land except at nesting colonies.<br><br>

It is distributed to the south of the Equator, through the temperate subantarctic zones of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, from the S of Australia in the East, S of Africa, to the waters of S of Brazil and N of Argentina in the West.<br><br>

Very similar to the Light-mantled Dusky Albatross (Phoebetria palpebrata), it differs by having a darker, brownish tone on the back, back and chest; and for having the line on the lower jaw yellow or orange, instead of blue or lilac.

## RECORDS IN CHILE

There is a record of a specimen hunted years ago in the surroundings of Cape Horn, whose skin is in the National Museum of Santiago (MNHN) (Goodall et al. 1951). However, the specimen was not found and is apparently lost (Marin, 2004). Little possible in Chilean waters, perhaps it should be considered as a Hypothetical Species (Marin, 2004).<br><br>

This skin was indeed found in the MNHN, as indicated in La Chiricoca 20 (Nov. 2015 - page 63). Includes photo of R. Barros.<br><br>

There is another record of 2 specimens in June 1996 in Cape Horn (Aguayo et al. 1998; Couve and Vidal 2000; Martinez and Gonzalez 2004).

## DISTRIBUTION (Clement's checklist 6.9)

S of Atlantic and Indian Oceans; north to parallel 30Â° S (Chile).

## IUCN CLASSIFICATION (2019)

EN: Endangered

## THREATS

Very rapid decline in three generations (90 years), probably due to interactions with fishing. Since 1980, three sites (Crozet, Marion and Gough) have seen steep declines, although the population in Prince Edward may have increased between 2002-2009 (IUCN 2019).

## LOCAL NAME(S)

## DISTRIBUTION IN CHILE

Throughout the entire Chilean sea, between Arica and Cape Horn.

## HABITAT

Pelagic

## DESCRIPTION

Length: 110 - 120 cm.<br>
Wingspan: 290 - 350 cm.<br><br>

White, with black primaries. Small black spots on some wing and scapular covers in juveniles. Bill pale pink with yellowish tip. Pale pink legs.

## FOOD

Mainly fish and squid; also crustaceans and carrion.

## REPRODUCTION

It nests near New Zealand. Posture of a white egg with reddish spots towards the blunt side; average size of 125 x 80 mm. app.

## OBSERVATIONS

It can be confused in its environment with the Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans), because they are very similar in appearance and size. Even, in past times, it was believed that they were a single species, the Wandering Albatross; but thanks to studies carried out by Mathews, Beck, Murphy and others, it was determined that they were different species with very different distribution and customs.<br><br>

One of the characteristics that determines the difference in the species is that the nostrils of the A. real are directed forwards, and those of the A. wandering gently upwards; but this difference can be seen only by comparing captured birds.<br><br>

Another characteristic is the shape of the wing during flight. The real A. folds the end a little back; and the wandering A. keeps it straight.<br><br>

Northern Royal Albatross (Diomedea sanfordi).

## DISTRIBUTION (Clement's checklist 6.9)

Campbell and Auckland Islands; circumpolar range in the southern oceans (Chile).

## IUCN CLASSIFICATION (2019)

VU: Vulnerable

## THREATS

Current population trends are assumed to be stable; however, it has a very small range of breeding grounds, breeding on four islands, though largely confined to just one, with a fifth mainland population comprising only hybrid birds; and therefore highly susceptible to stochastic effects and human impacts (IUCN 2019).

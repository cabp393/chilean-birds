Laying from mid-September to early October; hatching from the end of November, but mainly in December. Solitary or in loose groups. Large, mud and grass nest lined with feathers.

EN: Endangered

## THREATS

Bycatch in longline and trawl fisheries. It is known to be one of the most common species that follows fishing vessels (Olmos et al. 2000). Also rats and mice on some islands where they nest, impairing reproductive success (IUCN 2014).<br><br>
Very small breeding range and estimated to be experiencing a very rapid decline projected over three generations (72 years) due to incidental mortality in longline fisheries (IUCN 2019).
